# wx-star_false-color
False color files by wx-star.com for use with GOES-R Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) channel 02 and channel 13 Cloud Moisture Imagery Products (CMIPs) via High Rate Information Transmission (HRIT).

See full writeup here: https://wx-star.com/post/169608535305/designing-false-colors-for-goes-r-hrit

This repository will be used to track changes made to false color lookup tables and contrast curves designed by wx-star.com.

Files in the root directory are usable by:  
The Open Satellite Project's goesdump: https://github.com/opensatelliteproject/goesdump  
USA-Satcom's XRIT ingestor: https://usa-satcom.com/xrit-decoder-for-goes-satellite/  

Files for other application-specific false color implementations will be placed in their own subdirectories:  
goestools by Pieter Noordhuis: https://github.com/pietern/goestools  

Please note the false color files here are meant for GOES-R ABI CMIPs via HRIT and not for the GOES-N series of satellites.
